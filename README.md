# discord-teach-assist
Archived Discord bot that used an API for the teachassist platform to display student data in discord – historical screenshots and behavior documentation

Spawned from earlier projects involving discord bots that helped students with courses during COVID when many students myself included had to attend classes virtually. This project was in development about around 2021-2023 and made for fun. It used to be hosted on heroku until they updated their free tier in such a way that it was forced to migrate. An attempt was made to bring it to deta space but that service ended up shutting down.

## Dependencies
This project was built using:
- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
- [Fetch-TA-Data](https://github.com/PegasisForever/Fetch-TA-Data)

Subsequent API and permission model changes in Discord have made the
original implementation incompatible without a full rewrite.

## Screenshots

Examples of the bot’s behavior and commands are available in the
[`screenshots/`](./screenshots) directory.
